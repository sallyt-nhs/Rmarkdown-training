# Rmarkdown-training
A walk-through guide on how to create an html markdown document

## Getting Started
This training works best if you have a two-monitor setup: one screen to display the guide document, and the main screen for RStudio code and output.  

Open the [markdown training guide](final%20script/markdown-training-guide.html). It has been written for you to follow along, you will create your own version of this guide as you work through the document. You can compare your version with the code that produced the [original version](final%20script/markdown-training-guide.Rmd) if something isn't working correctly.
